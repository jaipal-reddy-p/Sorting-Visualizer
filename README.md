# Sorting-Visualizer

<p>Welcome to Sorting Visualizer, a web application designed to help you understand and visualize various sorting algorithms. This project was created to provide an interactive and engaging way to learn about sorting algorithms and their inner workings.</p>

<h3>Working of project</h3>

<ul>  
1. User Interaction:
  
<li>The user writes or selects a sorting algorithm in the code compiler.</li>
<li>The user selects the algorithm from the drop-down box.</li>
<li>Upon clicking "Run Code," the code is executed, and the selected algorithm is visualized.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
2. Code Execution:
  
<li>Capture the code input and run it using a JavaScript engine like WebAssembly or a backend service for other languages.</li>
<li>Ensure that the execution outputs the required data to be visualized.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
3. Visualization:
<li>Based on the selected algorithm, the visualization area animates the sorting process in real-time, displaying each step clearly.</li>
</ul>

# Programing Languages used: HTML5, CSS, and JS.
